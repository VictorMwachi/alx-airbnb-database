Performance Monitoring and Optimization Process

Property Bookings Query: Finding confirmed bookings for a specific property within a date range
Average Price Query: Calculating average booking price by property for the past year
Conflict Detection Query: Identifying booking date conflicts across properties

Key Bottlenecks Identified
Through detailed analysis, I discovered several critical performance issues:

Missing composite indexes for common query patterns
Full table scans instead of targeted index seeks
Inefficient join ordering causing excessive intermediate results
Complex filtering logic being evaluated after table scans
Temporary tables and multiple sort operations for aggregations

Implemented Optimizations
I addressed these bottlenecks with targeted optimizations:

Strategic composite indexes:
sqlCREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_status_dates ON booking(property_id, status, start_date, end_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_created_status ON booking(created_at, status);

Covering indexes to include frequently accessed columns:
sqlCREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_status_dates_covering 
ON booking(property_id, status, start_date, end_date)
INCLUDE (booking_id, user_id, total_price, guests);

Query refactoring:

Improved join ordering (filtering tables first)
Simplified date overlap logic
Used index hints where necessary
